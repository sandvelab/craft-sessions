Sandve Lab - Craft Sessions
===========================================

.. note::

   This website is under development.

Welcome to the Sandve Lab Craft Sessions!
This is a collection of resources for data scientists, software engineers, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists.
The goal of craft sessions is to discuss and learn about the best practices in these fields, share knowledge, and improve the skills.
Both soft and hard skills essential for success are covered, with custom content provided alongside links to valuable online materials and trainings.

The content is organized based on the level of complexity and the audience group: Postdocs (ðŸŒ³), PhD students (ðŸŒ¿), and Master's students (ðŸŒ±).
However, some sessions might be relevant for all groups (ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ±).
